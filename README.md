# P1-Implementaion-of-ML-Model-For-Image-Classification-AICTE-Internship
This project involves building a machine learning model for image classification, leveraging deep learning techniques to classify images into predefined categories. The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture implemented in TensorFlow and Keras. It includes preprocessing of image datasets, model training.

How to run the code
Check Python Installation
Run this in your terminal or command prompt:
bash
Copy code
python --version
If Python isn't installed, download and install it from: https://www.python.org/.

2. Install Required Libraries
You need TensorFlow, NumPy, and other dependencies. Install them with:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow numpy
3. Organize Your Dataset
The dataset should be structured like this:

bash
Copy code
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── class1/
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   ├── image2.jpg
│   ├── class2/
│       ├── image1.jpg
│       ├── image2.jpg
├── test/
│   ├── class1/
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   ├── image2.jpg
│   ├── class2/
│       ├── image1.jpg
│       ├── image2.jpg
Replace "path_to_training_data" with the path of the train directory.
Replace "path_to_testing_data" with the path of the test directory.
4. Replace Dataset Paths in the Code
Update these lines in the script with the correct paths:

python
Copy code
train_dir = "path_to_training_data"
test_dir = "path_to_testing_data"
Example:

python
Copy code
train_dir = "dataset/train"
test_dir = "dataset/test"
5. Save the Code
Save the provided Python code in a file, e.g., image_classification.py.

6. Run the Script
Use the command prompt or terminal to execute the script:

bash
Copy code
python image_classification.py
7. Monitor Model Training
During execution:

The script will preprocess your data from train and validation.
It will build and train the CNN model using the training data for 10 epochs.
The model will save as image_classifier_model.h5.
8. Evaluate the Model
After training, the code will evaluate your trained model using the testing dataset:

python
Copy code
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(test_generator)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
This will print the accuracy of your trained model on unseen testing data.

9. Optional: Predict Using the Model
You can use this function to classify a new image:

python
Copy code
def classify_image(img_path):
    img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    img_array = image.img_to_array(img) / 255.0
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
    predictions = model.predict(img_array)
    class_idx = np.argmax(predictions[0])
    class_label = list(train_generator.class_indices.keys())[class_idx]
    print(f"Predicted Class: {class_label}")
Replace img_path with the path of the image you want to classify.
Example:
python
Copy code
classify_image("dataset/test/class1/image1.jpg")
🛠️ Common Issues & Fixes
Issue	Fix
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'	Run pip install tensorflow.
Data is not loading correctly.	Check that the directory structure matches the required format.
Insufficient memory errors.	Decrease batch size by modifying batch_size=16.
Model is not training.	Ensure data paths are correct and data is accessible.
✅ Final Note
This code trains a CNN for image classification using your dataset. Ensure you:

Have enough images in each class for good training.
Monitor accuracy to validate performance. If accuracy is low, try experimenting with additional layers, more epochs, or data augmentation parameters.
